# ðŸšª Elevator Simulation using Tkinter

This project is a graphical simulation of a building elevator system implemented in **Python** using the **Tkinter** library. It features multiple elevators with visual movement, door animations, and a control panel to call elevators to various floors.

## ðŸ›  Features

- Three elevators: Door A, Door B, and Door C.
- Elevators serve different floor ranges:
  - Door A: Ground to Floor 5
  - Door B: Ground to Floor 8
  - Door C: Ground to Floor 10
- Realistic door animations (open/close).
- Floor buttons to call specific elevators.
- Activity log panel to track elevator movement.
- Demo mode to simulate elevator movement sequences.
